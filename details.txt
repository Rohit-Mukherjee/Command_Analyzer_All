Command Line Threat Analyzer (CLTA) - Full Tool Details

Project Name: Command Line Threat Analyzer (CLTA)
Repository: https://github.com/Rohit-Mukherjee/Command_Analyzer_All
License: MIT (assumed, please verify)
Language: Python
Platform: Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)

DESCRIPTION:
The Command Line Threat Analyzer (CLTA) is a comprehensive cybersecurity tool designed for detecting and analyzing suspicious command line activities across Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms. It addresses the critical challenge faced by cybersecurity analysts who must correlate multiple commands to understand the complete narrative of multi-stage attacks.

KEY FEATURES:
1. Multi-Platform Threat Detection
   - Comprehensive coverage across Windows, Linux, and macOS environments
   - Over 240+ detection rules organized hierarchically by OS, category, and specific techniques
   - Platform-specific attack vector recognition (PowerShell, WMI, Cron, LaunchAgents, etc.)

2. Hierarchical Rule Engine
   - Organized by Operating System → Category → Specific Rules
   - Regex-based pattern matching for flexible command detection
   - Unicode-safe processing for international character support
   - Dynamic severity scoring based on threat level and context

3. Advanced Behavioral Analysis
   - Anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual command patterns
   - Sequence analysis to detect multi-stage attack vectors
   - Temporal correlation to understand attack progression
   - Baseline establishment for normal command behavior

4. Threat Intelligence Integration
   - MITRE ATT&CK framework mappings for standardized threat categorization
   - Tactic and technique identification with confidence scoring
   - Detailed reporting with TTP (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) identification

5. Interactive Visualization Dashboard
   - Streamlit-based interactive dashboard for analysis results
   - Distribution charts showing threat patterns and frequencies
   - Timeline visualization of attack progression
   - Filtering and search capabilities for focused analysis
   - Export functionality for reporting and further investigation

6. Rule Creation Wizard
   - Interactive GUI for creating and testing detection rules
   - Visual rule creation with pattern generation
   - Dry-run testing capabilities before deployment
   - Real-time validation of rule effectiveness

MAIN COMPONENTS:
1. log_analyzer.py - Main analysis engine that processes command line logs against security rules with performance metrics, threat intelligence enrichment, and behavioral analysis integration.

2. rules_wizard_app.py - Interactive GUI for creating and testing detection rules with visual rule creation, pattern generation, and dry-run testing capabilities.

3. dashboard.py - Interactive visualization dashboard for analysis results with distribution charts, filtering, and export functionality.

4. threat_intel.py - MITRE ATT&CK framework integration providing tactic and technique mapping with confidence scoring.

5. behavioral_analyzer.py - Advanced behavioral analysis for anomaly detection using clustering algorithms and sequence analysis.

6. demo_environment.py - Comprehensive test scenarios including ransomware attacks, credential theft, lateral movement, persistence establishment, and data exfiltration.

ARCHITECTURE:
The tool follows a modular architecture with separate components for analysis, visualization, threat intelligence, and behavioral analysis. The rule engine is extensible and allows for custom rule creation through the GUI wizard.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
- All processing occurs locally - no data leaves the system
- Secure credential handling in configuration files
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Regular security audits of dependencies
