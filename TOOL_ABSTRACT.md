# Tool Description/Abstract

## Command Line Threat Analyzer (CLTA)

The Command Line Threat Analyzer (CLTA) is a comprehensive cybersecurity tool designed for detecting and analyzing suspicious command line activities across Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms. The tool addresses a critical challenge in cybersecurity operations: while security solutions often flag individual suspicious commands, cybersecurity analysts need to understand the broader context of attack sequences that unfold across multiple interconnected commands.

CLTA bridges this gap by automatically correlating related commands across time and context, providing behavioral analysis to identify attack patterns, and visualizing command sequences to reveal the complete narrative of multi-command attacks. The tool features over 240 detection rules organized hierarchically by operating system, category, and specific techniques, along with advanced behavioral analysis capabilities that go beyond signature matching to identify novel attack patterns.

Key features include multi-platform threat detection, a hierarchical rule engine with regex-based pattern matching, MITRE ATT&CK framework integration, an interactive visualization dashboard, and an intuitive rule creation wizard. The tool enables analysts to trace the complete story of an attack by analyzing command relationships, behavioral patterns, and temporal sequences across multiple commands, providing a holistic view of potential threats that traditional tools miss when focusing only on individual command detection.

CLTA is particularly valuable for incident response teams, threat hunters, and security operations centers that need to understand complex, multi-stage attacks that require deep command log analysis to comprehend the full scope of security incidents.
